# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Haar-Cascades-Classifier
This project is about building a model which detects faces with mask and those without mask in real time using OpenCV.  The Haar Cascades Classifier is being here to detect whether the face detected, is wearing a mask or not and put an appropriate message.
